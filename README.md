## ❗ Problem Statement

Despite witnessing or experiencing abuse, violence, or injustice, many citizens refrain from reporting due to fear, social stigma, or lack of trust in the system. There is a lack of secure, anonymous, and trustworthy platforms where people can safely raise their voices and expect real action.

**CivicEye aims to:**
- Eliminate the fear of retaliation while reporting.
- Provide evidence-backed, real-time reporting tools.
- Enable authorities and NGOs to act faster and more transparently.
- Ensure the integrity, privacy, and traceability of reports.
